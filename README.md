# Iris-Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization. The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.


Iris flower is divided into 3 species:

- setosa
- versicolor
- virginica

The iris dataset consists of 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The objective of this project is to predict the species given the four features of an iris flower.
