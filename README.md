# Iris-Dataset

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization. The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.


Iris flower is divided into 3 species:

- setosa
- versicolor
- virginica

The iris dataset consists of 4 features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The objective of this project is to predict the species given the four features of an iris flower.
